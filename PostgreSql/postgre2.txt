QUESTION NO 1:


The "film" table has the replacement cost and rental duration (assume, in weeks) for each movie.
Can you tell me the movies (just the title and relevant details) sorted by highest to lowest replacement cost and rented out for 4-6 weeks.
Also I don't want all the data, just give me 100 records. 

ANSWER 1: 

SELECT title, replacement_cost, rental duration
FROM film
ORDER BY replacement_cost DESC;

QUESTION NO 2:


I want a list of all movies that either have the rating 'G' or 'PG'.
The movies must be longer than 120 minutes in length, and they should have the word 'Action' anywhere in the description.

ANSWER 2: 

SELECT title, rating, length, description
FROM film
WHERE rating IN ('G' , 'PG')
AND length > 120
AND description LIKE '%Actions';
